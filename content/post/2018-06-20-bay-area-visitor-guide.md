The Bay Area is a collection of areas that resemble a very large city with multiple central business districts and suburbs. However the government of the areas are still quite different, so there are different public transport in different areas, different police and fire services, and even different tax rates. It's all a bit of a mess, but it seems to work. 

# San Francisco and nearby
San Francisco itself is geographically fairly small and dominated by various hills. Never 'San Fran', always 'the city' ;)

## Activities
- Twin Peaks. Brilliant views of the city. Walk or drive up to the top of Twin Peaks for great views of the city and ocean. Pick a clear time of day (late morning or early afternoon seem to be safest if you're not flexible, but the fog is funny sometimes). Cost: Free.
- Painted Ladies. A collection of nicely painted old houses. A bit underwhelming, but a nice place for a picnic and a bit of a view of San Francisco. Quite popular with tourists. Best at dusk or late afternoon as the sun is falling on the houses. Cost: Free. 
- Muir Woods. Full of redwoods and nice tracks to walk on. Can get busy if you don't get there as it opens. May need to pre-book parking, but you probably don't need much more than hour so someone could just stay with the car to avoid the parking issues. Cost: $7 per person.
- Barker Beach. Bad beach for swimming. Great beach for views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Can be a bit breezy. Cost: Free. 

## Food
- Ike's Place. 3489 16th St. Brilliant sandwiches. Go early or late, or call-ahead to avoid large lines. Try 'menage a trois'. Cost: c.$10 for a sandwich.
- Tartine Bakery. 600 Guerrero Street San Francisco. Very nice cakes. Avoid peak times otherwise there's big lines and it's hard to get a table. Cost: c.$7 for a slice of cake. 
- Sightglass. Nice coffee. Nice place to sit down. No wifi. Australians will be okay with this coffee, but it probably wouldn't survive in Sydney. Cost: c.$3 for coffee. 
- Blue Bottle coffee. Nice coffee. Very busy. Often a line. I like the iced coffee. Cost: c.$3 for coffee.
- La Taqueria. Carnitas burrito is better than beef burrito. Get sour cream. Carnitas taco is better than chicken taco. Special mention to the sauce. Cost: $7.50 for burrito
- El Farlito. Same as above.
- Bi-Rite Icecream. 3692 18th Street. Nice ice cream. Get the lavender one. Cost: $6 for three scoops.




# Berkeley/Albany
The economy of the Albany/Berkeley area is dominated by the university. There are around 100,000 people living in the area, and house prices are kept high by demand from university staff and techies from the city. 

## Activities
- Berkeley campus tour. A tour of the campus takes about an hour. Aspects worth seeing include: the parking spaces reserved for Nobel Prize winners; Bancroft Library; the demography department (!); the California Memorial Stadium, which seats about 60,000 people for football games (which Cal usually loses); South Hall, which was built in 1873 and is one of the two original buildings (the second was where the Bancroft Library now is). If you have time to kill, find a book and try the Reading Room.
- Campanile. The main feature is the Campanile, which is almost 100m tall. At the top of the Campanile are bells, but there are intermediate floors which are apparently used for fossil storage (public can't see them unfortunately). The Campanile opens at 10am. Great view of the university and surrounding area. Cost: $3. 

## Food
- Hot Shop. Burritos that have been influenced by Afghan cuisine. Cash only. Cost: c.$8.
-  Viks Chaat House. Cheap south Indian food. Cost: c.$10.
-  Cheeseboard Excellent pizza. PatricIans: `Fantastic, overall the seating, band, and food made for a lovely experience.' Cost: $20 for a whole pizza.
- Brazil Cafe. Excellent sandwiches. Tri-tip steak and Obama are both good. Cost: $10 for a sandwich.
-  Montague's Sandwich shop. Delicious sandwiches. Lots of customisation is possible. Try to go off-the-hour so to avoid biggest lines. Moderate wait. Very large sandwiches - can share one between two. Get the Dutch crunch bread, and pistrami is a good option. 2510 Channing Way. Cost: $6.90 per sandwich (ask for take away to avoid tax).
- Jayakata. Good Indonesian food. Satay's were disappointing, but noodle dish was delicious. Cost: c.$15 per person.
- Zachary's Chicago Style Pizza. Chicago style pizza which means a deep dish crust (not thick, but high), which is then filled with pizza topping. Perhaps resembles more of a pie than a pizza. People who haven't eaten deep dish in Chicago seem to rave about this place, but... ;) Cost: $30 for a whole pizza.
- Tacos El Autlense / Hotsy Totsy
Excellent tacos and more traditional burritos. Cash only. It's a take-away truck, but you can take your food to the bar next door if you have ID. Peppers on the side are a nice addition. Always get the hot sauce. PatricIans `The simplicity of the taco makes it delicious, and the bar adds to the experience'. Cost: c.$8 for  for a burrito. 
- Ajanta. Excellent Indian restaurant. Be guided by the staff as to what to order. Hotness level of 3 is a moderate heat and appropriate if you don't eat a lot of hot food, level 4 is good if you're used to hot food. Cost: $30 per person. 
- Ici. Ice cream shop. Amazing. 2948 College Avenue, Berkeley. Cost: $3 - $5 depending on options.
- Mrs. Dalloway's. Nice bookshop. 2904 College Ave, Berkeley. Cost: Expensive, but nice to browse.
- Jupiter. Bar with good, reasonably priced beer. Pizzas are fine. There is a nice outdoor area to sit, but it is often hard to get a seat. Cost: $5 for beer, $10 for pizza.
-  Sliver. Pizza place in downtown Berkeley. Similar pizza to Cheeseboard, but not as good. Reasonably cheap. Also serve jugs of beer and have sport showing on TV. Very good. Cost: $20 for whole pizza. 
- Ippuki. Japanese. Reasonably expensive but delicious. Good satay/smoked meats, soba, sake. 
- Bobby G's. Cheap and cheerful beer and pizza (especially at happy hour). Try to get Pliny the Elder. Cost:
