Blogdown allows you to make websites (not just blogs) without leaving R Studio. It sits on top of Hugo, which is a tool for making websites. A full book explaining how to use Blogdown can be used while it is being written - https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/ - and one of the authors of the book has a very helpful post - https://apreshill.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/. This post just sticks to the basics.
