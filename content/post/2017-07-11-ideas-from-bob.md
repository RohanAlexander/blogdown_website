Some possible research ideas in economic history from Bob Gregory (written on a napkin over lunch):

* 1929-31 Butlin/Bob Great Depression book; ABS has labour and wages; Valentine has models, but not much data.
* WWII financing in Australia - how did they do this? Bob had initial paper but not followed through on.
* Pre-WWII female wage and employment compared with post-WWII.
* Demographics of the pill -- who did it impact?
