By linking data on Ellis Island arrivals with the 1940 US Census [Zach Ward](https://sites.google.com/site/zachaward/) and I estimate the effect of age at arrival for immigrant outcomes in the US. Using within-family variation, Zach and I find that arriving at an older age, or having more childhood exposure to the European environment, led to a larger negative wage gap compared to the native born. Those who arrived as infants had no income gap relative to natives, in contrast to those who arrived as teenagers. Therefore, a key determinant of immigrant outcomes during the Age of Mass Migration was the country of residence during critical periods of childhood development.
