We find that brothers who arrived at younger ages, or those with more childhood exposure to the American environment, had much higher adult incomes than older-arriving brothers. The high return to human capital acquired during childhood contrasts with a low rate of assimilation during this period. We further show that the quality of childhood environment is a primary determinant of a source country’s skill gap with natives, and may be more important than other factors like selection."

Zach Ward and I estimate the importance of childhood environment for immigrant outcomes with
a new dataset of arrivals linked to the 1940 US Census. We find that brothers who arrived at
younger ages, or those with more childhood exposure to the American environment, had much
higher adult incomes than older-arriving brothers. The high return to human capital acquired
during childhood contrasts with a low rate of assimilation during this period. We further show
that the quality of childhood environment is a primary determinant of a source country’s skill
gap with natives, and may be more important than other factors like selection.
