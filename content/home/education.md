# My first project looks at social mobility in Australia. The extent to which a personâ€™s ancestors determines their own economic outcomes has many implications for the types of policies that are appropriate today. I start with the names of people born in Tasmania between 1777 and 1899. Using data sources such as parliamentary records, school attendence, and business registration, I classify some of these people as 'high status'. By comparing the names of that high status group with the names of today's high status group I can estimate the degree of social mobility in Tasmania.

# My second project looks at the Federation of Australia which culminated on 1 January 1901. But it took many elections for this federation of six former British colonies to occur. Understanding who voted for the Federation of Australia, and why the outcome of several critical elections changed, allows us to better appreciate why voters decided to add a level of government when only a couple of generations earlier they insisted on political independence from Britain.
