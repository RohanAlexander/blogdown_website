# Biography

I am a PhD student in the Research School of Economics at the Australian National University where I research Australian economic history. As part of my current project with Tim Hatton I create, merge, and analyse census and election datasets from around Federation.

I am a co-founder of Petit Poll, which uses statistical methods to produce Australian political polls. And I am a consultant at Grosvenor Management Consulting, where I analyse Australian public-sector procurement.

Outside of research, teaching and work I enjoy cycling and running.
