# Biography

I am a PhD student in the Research School of Economics at the Australian National University where I research Australian economic history. My panel is [John Tang](https://sites.google.com/site/jptang/) (primary supervisor), [Martine Mariotti](https://www.cbe.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/?profile=Martine-Mariotti) (chair), and [Zach Ward](https://sites.google.com/site/zachaward/).

I am a co-founder of [Petit Poll](https://www.petitpoll.com/), which uses a statistical model to produce Australian political polls from biased samples that we collect. And I consult at [Grosvenor Management Consulting](https://www.grosvenor.com.au/) on public-sector procurement data.

Outside of university and work I enjoy cycling and running.
