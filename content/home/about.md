# Biography

I am a PhD student in the Research School of Economics at the Australian National University where I research Australian economic history and am a tutor for Macroeconomics 3. My panel is [John Tang](https://sites.google.com/site/jptang/) (primary supervisor), [Zach Ward](https://sites.google.com/site/zachaward/) and [Martine Mariotti](https://www.cbe.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/?profile=Martine-Mariotti). As part of my current project with [Tim Hatton](https://sites.google.com/site/timhattonwebsite/) I create, merge and analyse Federation-era census and election datasets. 

I am a co-founder of Petit Poll, which uses statistical methods to produce Australian political polls from biased samples. And I am a consultant at Grosvenor Management Consulting, where I analyse Australian public-sector procurement.

Outside of research, teaching and work I enjoy cycling and running.
